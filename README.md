# Hypothesis-Testing-Using-t-test
This project was the final project of the course [Introduction to Data Science in Python (University of Michigan)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis), which is the first section of the [Applied Data Science with Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python).
The course focuses on data manipulation and cleaning techniques using the numpy and pandas packages and introduce the abstraction of the Series and DataFrame as the central data structures for data analysis, as well as common function used by these packages.

The aim of the project was to examine the following hypothesis: University towns have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions. The was to examine it was to run a t-test to compare the ratio of the mean price of houses in university towns the quarter before the recession starts compared to the recession bottom. The project involved mainly the following practices:
* Extensive use of pandas
* Reading and using csv, txt and excel files
* Combining data from multiple sources
* Running a t-test

Files details:
* final_assignment.ipynb - the notebook with the code. The guidelines at the top of the notebook and the functions' docstrings were provided as part of the template.
* university_towns.txt - this file contains all of the college and university towns in the united states. It was taken from a Wikipedia webpage.
* gdplev.xls - the file contains the US GDP per year and quarter, taken from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, US Department of Commerce
* City_Zhvi_AllHomes.csv - the file contains housing data and home sale prices from Zillow research data site.
