# Hypothesis-Testing-Using-t-test
This project was the final project of the course [Introduction to Data Science in Python (University of Michigan)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis), which is the first section of the [Applied Data Science with Python Specialization specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python).
The course focuses on data manipulation and cleaning techniques using the numpy and pandas packages and introduce the abstraction of the Series and DataFrame as the central data structures for data analysis, as well as common function used by these packages.
The project involves mainly the following practices:
* Extensive use of pandas
* Reading and using csv, txt and excel files
* Combining data from multiple sources
* Running a t-test
